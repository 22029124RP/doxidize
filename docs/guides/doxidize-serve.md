# `doxidize serve`

This command takes the documentation in the `target/docs` directory and
runs a local web server so you can view them in your browser.

```shell
$ doxidize serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7878` in your browser.

It takes no parameters.

## Web Server Requirements

Doxidize does not need any special kind of server to run; this is only for
convenience.
