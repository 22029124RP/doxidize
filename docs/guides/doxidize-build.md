# `doxidize build`

This command takes the documentation you've written in the `docs` directory
and renders it to the `target/docs` directory.

```shell
$ doxidize build
```

It takes no parameters.

## `README.md` support

`README.md` will be transformed into `index.html`, so that on GitHub, you can
see it rendered, but when you put your docs on the web, you can see them at a
nicer URL.
