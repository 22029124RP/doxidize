# Doxidize

Excellent documentation for Rust.

## Installation

To get Doxidize:

```shell
$ cargo install doxidize
```

## Workflow

First, initialize Doxidize for your project:

```shell
$ doxidize
```

This will create a top-level `docs` dir and a `README.md` file inside of it.

Edit the `README.md` to your heart's content.
